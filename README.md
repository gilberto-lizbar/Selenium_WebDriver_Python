**1.What is PIP installer Tool?**

pip is a package management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python

pip is a recursive acronym that can stand for either "Pip Installs Packages" or "Pip Installs Python

**2.Where do we get this PIP Tool?** 

Included with Python Installations: In most cases, when you install Python (versions 2.7.9+ or 3.4+), 
pip is automatically included and installed alongside it. This is the most common and recommended method for acquiring pip.

Separate Installation on Some Linux Systems: On certain Linux distributions like Ubuntu, pip might be packaged separately as python3-pip.
In such cases, you would install it using your system's package manager, for example:

sudo apt install python3-pip

**pip install selenium**

This command will set up the Selenium WebDriver client library on your machine with all modules and classes that we will need to create automated scripts using Python

The optional –U flag will upgrade the existing version of the installed package

**7. Pytest execution commands**
  
  **py.test** # execute all pytest from path folder
  
  **py.test [test_name.py]** # execute file given file (example: py.test test_demo1.py)
  
  **py.test -v** # -v print executed methods on tests from path folder
  
  **py.test -v -s** # -s print console logs

  **py.test -k [text]** # -k [text] find and run test methods from actual folder which contains the given text
  (example: py.test -k CreditCard)

  **Using tags**

  **py.test -m [tag]** # -m [mark] This will run all the tests which contains the mark/tag from actual folder
  - (example: py.test -m smoke) executes the tests with 'smoke' mark which belongs to method test_secondGreetCreditCard
  
  @pytest.mark.smoke 
  
  def test_secondGreetCreditCard():
  
  - If a method contains skip mark, test won't be executed and will be reported as skipped on results
  
  @pytest.mark.smoke

  @pytest.mark.skip
  
  def test_firstProgram():
  
  - If a method contain xfail mark, It means a test will be executed but not reported as fail it will 
  be reported as XPASS instead, You can add xfail tag when need to run a test even you know it fails or 
  has a dependency where need to run a particular test for further tests
  
  @pytest.mark.smoke

  @pytest.mark.xfail
